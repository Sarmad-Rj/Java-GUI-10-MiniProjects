## üìÅ Java GUI ‚Äì 10 Mini Projects Challenge

üë®‚Äçüíª *by Sarmad Rj*

This repository is the result of my self-imposed challenge:
**‚Äú10 Java Projects in 5 Days‚Äù** ‚Äì where I pushed myself to explore and build real-world mini-projects using Core Java & Swing. Each project helped reinforce a new concept or library.

## üß† Highlights & Learnings

- **Core Java mastery**: Collections, file handling, loops, conditions, OOP patterns, threading, `HashMap`, `Threads`, and `File Handling`
- **Networking & concurrency**: Built a real-time chat app handling multiple users with threads
- **API consumption & UI**: Integrated weather data via REST API and rendered data cleanly in Swing
- **Sound & Interactive apps**: Translated text to Morse and played it via live console audio
- **Secrets management**: Hidden API keys & Mongo URI using environment variables, `.env` files and `.gitignore`‚Äîprotecting creds from public repo exposure
- Learned how different Java APIs and libraries fit together to make complete desktop tools.
